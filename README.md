## Presentation

[Lionheart Remake](http://www.b3dgs.com/v7/page.php?lang=en&section=lionheart_remake) is a __platform game__, keeping as much as possible elements of the [__original game__ (1992)](http://hol.abime.net/894).
The story is the same: You, a Cat-Man called Valdyn, got new capacity by The King, in order to destroy the growing threat of Norka, a monster wanting to destroy The Kingdom.
Llene, promised woman of Valdyn has been kidnapped. Valdyn has to search for Norka, far of The Kingdom, in order to find her.
But the trip won't be easy !

Indeed, your long tour is divided into several parts.
You will have to cross a lot of areas before to reach the end.
The adventure is made up of 14 levels by including 9 distinct areas.
Each area has its own elements, monsters...
