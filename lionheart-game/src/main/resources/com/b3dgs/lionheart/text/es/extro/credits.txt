L11 Just want to hand out a big 'thank you' to all
L11 dedicated LH supporters out there. I really
L11 appreciate it and i hope to give something back
L11 one day. Also would like to praise Pierre-Alexandre
L11  for doing such a insanely good job and keeping it
L11 all alive for old and new LH gamers! I'm always
L11 looking back with lots of good thoughts and fun
L11 developing LH in those days discovering my
L11 capabilities fed by all the other talented people
L11 around me. It just makes me proud that people still
L11 appreciate the work done so many years ago.
L11 Thanks and may the pixel be with you! :)

L11 After working in the games industry for 20 years,
L11 most get hard-boiledand jaded. So many games
L11 produced, so much work invested, and for what?
L11 Games are high tech and are obsolete so very fast.
L11 Nobody remembers the hits of last year, not to
L11 mention old 16 bit games, right? And then there
L11 is the occasional moment that reminds me why I'm
L11 still passionate about making games even after all
L11 these years. To some people, the games we worked
L11 on so long ago are part of their memories and of
L11 their youth. They had an emotional impact to them,
L11 they mattered and made a difference to at least
L11 some. And that makes it all worth while - the long
L11 hours, the daily struggle. Projects like the
L11 Lionheart remake and people like Pierre-Alexandre,
L11 it's creator, reassure me that I've made the right
L11 decision to dedicate my professional life to games.
L11 And for that reassurance, I thank Pierre-Alexandre,
L11 the original creators of Lionheart, Henk Nieborg,
L11 Erwin Kloibhofer, Michael Bittner and Matthias
L11 Steinwachs. And most of all, thanks to everybody
L11 out there who had fun with our games and who still
L11 remembers...

L11 For the re-release-remake-re-anything-whatever of
L11 that great game (thanks a lot to Pierre-Alexandre
L11 - great job, man) its time to reveal a secret:
L11 Did you ever asked yourself "Who is that hero with
L11 that long blonde hair in Lionheart?" So here it
L11 comes: Its Henk, the graphic designer! So if you
L11 now also find Erik, Erwin & me maybe you'll win a
L11 prize :-) So have fun to play Lionheart & feel
L11 free to visit my website (www.audiotexturat.de)
L11 And yes - someday the music-remake will come -
L11 its done when its done...

L11 Well, once again I made another remake of my
L11 childhood game, Lionheart. I think it is the 4th
L11 remake, but this one is now working on both PC
L11 and Android ! It uses my own game engine, the
L11 LionEngine (guess the name's origin...), full
L11 java implementation, with special C library for
L11 SonicArranger emulation (on Android too). This
L11 remake is my best copy from the original game,
L11 considering all aspects (even finer details).
L11 I hope you will enjoy this remake again, and
L11 see you for another project !

L11 En memoria de los viejos Juegos...
L11 no dejes que el Amiga muera !
